Here is a list of tips and techniques that will help you when taking an exam. These have proven to be very helpful to my students, readers, watchers, and especially, for me!

## General Practices for Taking Exams

**Pick a good time for the exam** 

Schedule a time that works well for you, when you don’t have to worry about anything else. DO NOT schedule the exam until you are READY! It is understandable that deadlines have to be set sometimes, but in general, don’t register for the exam until you feel confident you can pass. Things come up in life that can sometimes get in the way of your study time. Keep in mind that most exams can be canceled as long as you give 48 hours’ notice. (To be sure, check that time frame when registering.)


**Don’t overstudy the day before the exam** 

Some people like to study hard the day before; some don’t. My recommendations are to study from your cheat sheet and maybe run through some quick Q&A, but in general, don’t overdo it. It’s not a good idea to go into overload mode the day before (or the day of) the exam. Consider doing some exercise or something fun instead! 


**Get a good night’s rest** 

A good night’s sleep (seven to nine hours) before the day of the exam is probably the best way to get your mind ready for an exam.


**Eat a decent breakfast** 

Eating is good! Breakfast is number two when it comes to getting your mind ready for an exam, especially if it is a morning exam. Just watch out for the coffee and tea. Too much caffeine if you are not used to it can be detrimental to the thinking process.


**Create a CLEAN testing area**

One best practice is to have a completely clean desk above and below. Nothing on it or below it. The online proctor will ask you to either remove or show any items that are visible (which is time consuming and difficult to do with a webcam). Remove as much clutter from the room (and especially the desk) as possible. You can have a clear container for water, no labels. 


**Show up early** 

Be present 30 minutes prior to your scheduled exam time. (As of the writing of this document, HashiCorp certification exams are taken online.) This is important: Give yourself plenty of time. You will need to do audio/video checks, webcam sweeps, capture your ID, shut down apps, etc... *You will need the time.* 

These types of distractions can be stressful. Stress and fear are the mind killers. Work on reducing any types of stress the day of and the day before the exam by preparing as much as possible. 

> Note: Most proctors do not allow ear plugs. Make sure you are testing in a quiet environment. Consider putting a sign on the door that says "TESTING, QUIET PLEASE!" or something similar.


**Take small breaks while taking the exam** 

Exams can be brutal. You have to answer a lot of questions (typically anywhere from 50 to 90) while staring at a screen for an hour or more. I recommend small breaks and breathing techniques. For example, after going through every 20 questions or so, close your eyes and slowly take a few deep breaths, holding each one for five seconds and then releasing each one slowly. Think about nothing while doing so. Remove the test from your mind during these breaks. This technique takes only about half a minute but can help get your brain refocused. It’s almost a Zen type of thing; but for me, when I have applied this technique properly, I have gotten a few perfect scores. It’s amazing how the mind-set can make or break you.


**Be confident** 

You have studied hard, gone through the practice exams, created your cheat sheet - you’ve done everything you can to prep. These things alone should build confidence. But actually, you just have to be confident for no reason whatsoever. Think of it this way: You are great…I am great…(to quote Dr. Daystrom). But truly, there is no disputing this. That’s the mentality you must have. You are not being pretentious about this if you think it to yourself. Acting that way to others…well, that’s another matter. So build that inner confidence, and your mind-set should be complete.

## Smart Methods for Difficult Questions

**Use the process of elimination** 

If you are not sure about an answer, first eliminate any answers that are definitely incorrect. You might be surprised how often this approach works. This is one of the reasons it is recommended that you not only know the correct answers to the practice exam questions but also know why the wrong answers are wrong. The testing center should give you something to write on; use it by writing down the letters of the answers that are incorrect to keep track. Even if you aren’t sure about the correct answer, if you can logically eliminate anything that is incorrect, the answer will become apparent. To sum it up, the character Sherlock Holmes said it best: “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” There’s more to it, of course, but from a scientific standpoint, this method can be invaluable.


**Be logical in the face of adversity** 

The most difficult questions are when two answers appear to be correct, even though the test question requires you to select only one answer. Real exams do not rely on trick questions. Sometimes you need to slow down, think logically, and compare the two possible correct answers. Also, you must imagine the scenario that the question is a part of. Think through step by step what is happening in the scenario. Write out as much as you can. The more you can visualize the scenario, the better you can figure out which of the two answers is the best one.


**Use your gut instinct** 

Sometimes a person taking a test just doesn’t know the answer; it happens to everyone. If you have read through the question and all the answers and used the process of elimination, sometimes this is all you have left. In some scenarios, you might read a question and instinctively know the answer, even if you can’t explain why. Tap into this ability. Some test-takers write down their gut instinct answers before delving into the question and then compare their thoughtful answers with their gut instinct answers.


**Don’t let one question beat you!** 

Don’t let yourself get stuck on one question, especially the performance-based questions. Skip it (flag it) and return to it later. When you spend too much time on one question, the brain gets sluggish. The thing with these exams is that you either know the content or you don’t. And don’t worry too much about it; chances are you are not going to get a perfect score. Remember that the goal is only to pass the exams; how many answers you get right after that is irrelevant. If you have gone through this book thoroughly, you should be well prepared. You should have plenty of time to go through all the exam questions with time to spare to return to the ones you skipped and marked.


**If all else fails, guess** 

Remember that the exams might not be perfect. A question might seem confusing or appear not to make sense. Leave questions like this until the end. After you have gone through all the other techniques mentioned, make an educated, logical guess. Try to imagine what the test is after and why it would be bringing up this topic, as vague or as strange as it might appear.

## Wrapping Up the Exam

**Review all your answers!!** 

If you finish early, use the time allotted to you to review the answers. Chances are you will have time left over at the end, so use it wisely. Make sure that everything you have flagged has a proper answer that makes sense to you. Make sure that if you change an answer, that you click "Answer" again to record the new answer. 
However, try not to overthink. Give the exam your best shot, and be confident in your answers. You don’t want to second-guess yourself.

In closing, confidence is the key when taking an exam. 

*Remember, you can do this!*
